# DEI Transparency Token System

This Clarity smart contract implements a decentralized system to encourage transparent reporting of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) metrics by companies. It uses a tokenized reward mechanism and community auditing to validate submitted reports.

## Features

* **Company Registration**: Entities can register and begin reporting diversity metrics.
* **DEI Reporting**: Registered companies submit structured diversity reports.
* **Auditor Governance**: Approved auditors verify submitted reports.
* **Token Incentives**: Verified reports earn `dei-token` rewards.
* **Reward Pool**: Public STX donations are distributed as incentives to compliant companies.
* **Transparency Score**: Companies build reputation based on report frequency and approval.

## Token

* **`dei-token`**: Fungible token rewarded to companies for approved diversity reports.

## Data Structures

* **Companies Map**: Stores registration info, reporting history, and status.
* **Diversity Reports Map**: Structured data on gender, ethnicity, leadership, pay equity, and initiatives.
* **Report Counter Map**: Tracks the number of reports per company.
* **Auditor Votes Map**: Records auditor approvals or rejections.
* **Auditors Map**: Verifies if a principal is an approved auditor.

## Public Functions
